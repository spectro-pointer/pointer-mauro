        grease
        right torque in screws

- OOP
	Pointer/Axes abstractions
		Parallel/GPIOAxis?
    	Parallel with threaded axes
    	
- GUI:
	Settings
	Telescope pointing
	Window sweeping
	Moving target tracking
		webcam based
	
- Raspberry Pi
	webcam
		Logitech driver
		Pi supported webcam driver

	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
			
- pointer server:
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing
	- GPS
        Use time, height, speed and heading from GPS
        Independent GPS data module

    	based on accel elevation
    	based on webcam image movement?
    usb webcam
    	compass
    	level
    	target tracking
    config
        server-side config file
        	see pyrit's config
        	save pos/settings at exit

        set change dir adjust offsets
        set relative to zero offsets
        	True North(Including magnetic declination)
        	0ยบ Elevation
