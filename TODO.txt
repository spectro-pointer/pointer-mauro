- General
    Fix start up delay
        ~1 sec.
        gps?

    Fix client dependencies:
        no GPIO -> no root
        	works in Ubuntu
        	what about pi? 

- GUI:
	Settings
	Window sweeping
	Moving target tracking
		webcam based

	Light target tracking
		webcam based
        opencv
        client processing?
	
- Raspberry Pi
    Fix /dev/mem access permissions for gpio
	webcam
		Logitech driver

	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
		
	limit switches (integrated into Axis)
		axis homing function
			check first, then move
			dir heuristics
		save config
			
- pointer server:
	- Adjust axis speeds to arrive at the same time in elevation and azimuth(nice)
	
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing (i.e. elevation control)
        use gyroscope

    - Gyro
        driver
	
	- GPS
		See gps/TODO.txt
	    Use height and time from GPS

        Continue if no gps/gpsd(exception handling)
        
        Independent gpsData class
        	time
        	lat
        	lon
        	height
        	speed
        	heading
	
	duty cycle?
	
    dir change auto adjust
    	based on accel elevation
    	based on webcam image movement?
    
    webcam
    	compass
    	level
    	target tracking
        light tracking
    
    config
        server-side config file
        	see pyrit's config
        	save pos/settings at exit

        set change dir adjust offsets
        set relative to zero offsets
        	True North(Including magnetic declination)
        	0º Elevation

        set speed/ on/off delay

        auto calibrate
        	dir change offsets
        		using webcam/accelerometer
            max speed
                using webcam/switches
        ...
        
Functions:
	- Telescope pointing (done)
		RA/Dec

            gps time
            
            diurnal parallax corrections
            height corrections
			
			misalignment sources
				time skewing

		Earth rotation compensation, i.e. tracking
		
	- Target tracking
		moving target detection
			webcam based
			picam based
			
		brightness/color tracking
			max brightness tracking
			specific color(green laser?) tracking
	
	- Window sweeping
