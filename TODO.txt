- General
    Fix start up delay
        ~1 sec.
        gps?

    Fix client dependencies:
        no GPIO -> no root
        	works in Ubuntu
        	what about pi? 
- Axis
	homing(done)
		config file
    fix speed divergences when more than one axis moving(GIL?)
        tune/adjust speed

- Config file
    server-side
    	see pyrit's config
    	save pos/settings at exit

    set relative to zero offsets
    	True North(Including magnetic declination)
    	0ยบ Elevation (use gyro?)

    set speed/ on/off delay

    auto calibrate
    	using webcam/accelerometer/gyro/ending switches
        max speed
            using webcam/switches
    ...
	
- Raspberry Pi
    Fix /dev/mem access permissions for gpio

	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
				
- pointer server:
	- Switch 'telescope' vs. 'serve' modes
		support both at the same time?
	
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing (i.e. elevation control)
        use gyroscope

    - Gyro
        driver
        kalman filter
        elevation reading/feedback control
	
	- GPS
		See gps/TODO.txt
	    Use height and time from GPS

        Continue if no gps/gpsd(exception handling)
        
        Independent gpsData class
        	time
        	lat
        	lon
        	height
        	speed
        	heading
	
	duty cycle?
	
    webcam
    	compass

camera server:
    Fix:
        mouse pointer with telescope
	    marshall_none
        video client reconnect
        eval (security)

    properties
    multi get
    multi set
    default get
    default set/reset

    get/set framerate

    take picture
        binary channel
        resolution
        
    motion detection/target tracking
		picamera based
        server based
        opencv based
            video frame to opencv?
            capture frame with use_video_port=True(and different splitter_port)?
            ?

Functions:
	- GUI
		Settings
	
	- Motion detection/Moving target detection/tracking
		
	- Light/brightness/color tracking
		max brightness tracking
		specific color(i.e. laser) tracking
		client processing?
		
	- Insect/fly detection/tracking
		client processing?
	
	- Window sweeping
		custom window
		custom speeds

	- Telescope pointing (done)
		RA/Dec
			ntp time (done)
            gps time
            
            diurnal parallax corrections
            height corrections
			
			misalignment sources
				time skewing
				true elevation
				magnetic vs. geographic North
					gps north?
					magnetic declination table
