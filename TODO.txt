- General
    Fix start up delay
        ~1 sec.
        gps?

    Fix client dependencies:
        no GPIO -> no root

- OOP
	Pointer/Axes abstractions
    	
- GUI:
	Settings
	Window sweeping
	Moving target tracking
		webcam based

	Light target tracking
		webcam based
        opencv
        client processing?
	
- Raspberry Pi
    Fix /dev/mem access permissions for gpio
	webcam
		Logitech driver

	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
			
- pointer server:
	- Adjust axis speeds to arrive at the same time in elevation and azimuth(nice)
	
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing (i.e. elevation control)
        use gyroscope

    - Gyro
        driver
	
	- GPS
		See gps/TODO.txt
	    Use height and time from GPS

        Continue if no gps/gpsd(exception handling)
