	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
			
- pointer server:
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing
	- GPS based latitude and longitude settings
        gspd python client
        use lat,lon,height and date from gps
	
	duty cycle?
    dir change auto adjust
    	based on accel elevation
    	based on webcam image movement?
    usb webcam
    	compass
    	level
    	target tracking
    config
        server-side config file
        	see pyrit's config
        	save pos/settings at exit

        set change dir adjust offsets
        set relative to zero offsets
        	True North(Including magnetic declination)
        	0º Elevation

        set speed/ on/off delay

        auto calibrate
        	dir change offsets
        		using webcam
            max speed
