    Fix start up delay
        ~1 sec.
        gps?

    Fix client dependencies:
        no GPIO -> no root
        	works in Ubuntu
        	what about pi? 
- Axis

- Config file
    server-side
    	see pyrit's config
    	save pos/settings at exit

    set change dir adjust offsets
    set relative to zero offsets
    	True North(Including magnetic declination)
    	0ยบ Elevation

    set speed/ on/off delay

    auto calibrate
    	dir change offsets
    		using webcam/accelerometer
        max speed

- Raspberry Pi
    Fix /dev/mem access permissions for gpio

	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
				
- pointer server:
	- Add/integrate 'camera' server mode
		camera settings protocol
	
	- Switch 'telescope' vs. 'serve' modes
		support both at the same time?
	
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing (i.e. elevation control)
        use gyroscope

    - Gyro
        driver
	
	- GPS
		See gps/TODO.txt
	    Use height and time from GPS

        Continue if no gps/gpsd(exception handling)
