- General
    Fix Z stuck
        better construction
        grease
        right torque in screws

- OOP
	Pointer/Axes abstractions
		Parallel/GPIOAxis?
    	Parallel with threaded axes
    	
- GUI:
	Settings
	Telescope pointing
	Window sweeping
	Moving target tracking
		webcam based
	
- Raspberry Pi
	webcam
		Logitech driver
		Pi supported webcam driver

	accelerometer
		better angle estimations
			
- pointer server:
	- Accelerometer based elevation angle setting
		integrate accel elevation reading into pointing
	- GPS
        Use time, height, speed and heading from GPS
        Independent GPS data module
        	time
        	lat
        	lon
        	height
        	speed
        	heading
	
	duty cycle?
    dir change auto adjust
    	based on accel elevation
    	based on webcam image movement?
    usb webcam
    	compass
    	level
    	target tracking
    config
        server-side config file
        	see pyrit's config
        	save pos/settings at exit

        set change dir adjust offsets
        set relative to zero offsets
        	True North(Including magnetic declination)
        	0º Elevation

        set speed/ on/off delay

        auto calibrate
        	dir change offsets
